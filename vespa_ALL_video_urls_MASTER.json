We explore a common but often misdiagnosed issue in modern software: search problems hiding in plain sight. \n\nWhen users struggle with irrelevant results, poor UX, or high bounce rates, teams typically reach for the usual fixes\u2014frontend tweaks, more testing, or scaling infrastructure. But in many cases, the real issue isn\u2019t performance or design. It\u2019s search.\n\nWe unpack why so many teams miss the mark, how conventional roles (frontend",

> Ankit's email style, templates, and best practices for Claude to reference.

## Ankit's Email Voice

### Tone
- **Conversational and friendly** - like talking to a smart friend
- **Never corporate** - no formal language, no jargon
- **Gets straight to the point** - short paragraphs, easy to scan
- **Genuine interest** - shows curiosity about what people are building
- **Offers concrete help** - credits, calls, Slack channels, resources

### Structure
1. **Greeting**: "Hey [FirstName]," or "Hey," (never "Dear" or "Hello")
   - Use "Hey," without name for agency/consulting partners when you don't have first name
2. **Quick intro**: One line about who I am (only if needed, especially for agency partners)
3. **Personalized hook**: Something specific about their company
4. **Value offer**: What I can help with
5. **Soft CTA**: Call, Slack channel, or reply
6. **Sign-off**: "Talk soon!" (never "Best regards" or "Sincerely")
7. **PS**: Optional gesture or extra value

### Example (Gold Standard)
```
Hey Philip,

I see you are trying out Chroma Cloud. Let me know if you have any questions or need more credits to test.

If you are building a retrieval app, I want to point you to our newly launched Search API at https://docs.trychroma.com/cloud/search-api/overview

It supports generic vector search and hybrid with RRF.

I'm happy to hop on a call or set up a shared Slack channel, whatever works best for you.

I've been checking out Synca - really cool what you're building! There are a bunch of ways we can boost what Synca offers, especially around semantic search over knowledge bases, intelligent content retrieval for your AI agents.

Have cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: I am bumping up your credit to $500 as a small gesture!
```

- Good: "Chroma Cloud + [Company]" (used for Agile Cyber)
- Good: "Quick question about [Company]'s AI stack"

## What to Research Before Emailing

1. **Company website** - What do they do? What's their product?
2. **LinkedIn** - Who is the person? What's their role?
3. **Tech stack** - Are they using AI? RAG? Agents?
4. **Recent news** - Any funding? Product launches?
5. **Competitors** - Are they using a competitor?

## Gestures by Lead Type

| Startup (B+) | $1,000 | Slack channel, call with Jeff |
| Enterprise | $2,000+ | Slack channel, dedicated support |
| Agency/Partner | $500 per client POC | Partner program, early access |

---

## Things to Always Include

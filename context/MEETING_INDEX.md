## Key Insights by Theme

### 🎯 GTM Strategy
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: ICP is only 2-5k accounts; need high-touch, not SMB grind. SDR agency negotiation ongoing.
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: Best ICP = multi-tenant SaaS (Notion, Slack-like). Signal data: 5,800 companies hiring AI engineers.

### 💰 Fundraising
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: Raise in Jan 2025 window. Narrative: context layer + search agent, not "vector DB."

### 🛠️ Product Roadmap
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: Search Agent → Observability → Context Layer → ChromaFS. Near-term focus on attach products.

### 📣 Marketing & Content
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: 8-week content calendar with weekly announcements. Start with "won open source game."
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: Every update = text + video. LinkedIn organic via founder accounts > LinkedIn ads. Clarity + benchmarks in creative.

### 🏢 Competitive Intel
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: Pinecone overspent early. TurboPuffer acquisition talks failed. PGVector companies = Search Agent targets.
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: TurboPuffer: 200-500k impressions per testimonial ad, Cursor co-brand worked. Vespa: benchmark-heavy ads. Pinecone dominates "split search" SEO.

### 📺 Paid Ads
- **2024-12-23 (Prash/Demand Curve)**: $5-10k/month budget. LinkedIn ABM (2k companies + job titles → 30-50k audience). Google/YouTube for retargeting competitor visitors. Reddit for devs.
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: Meta ~8% CTR (best), LinkedIn <1% CTR. Don't manage dashboards—hire specialists. Wait for clarity before heavy spend.

### 🤝 Agencies/Partners
- **2024-12-23 (Demand Curve)**: NDA sent to Justin. Prash = senior paid lead. Focus on SQLs not MQLs. Proposal pending.

### 🔧 GTM Infrastructure / Tooling
- **2024-12-23 (Common Room)**: Evaluating for identity resolution + signal aggregation. Custom demo Dec 29 or week of Jan 5. Decision by 2nd week of January.
- **Also evaluating**: High Touch (reverse ETL), Rio.dev (GitHub signals)
- **Key insight**: "Hard part isn't collecting signals—it's stitching them into one identity"

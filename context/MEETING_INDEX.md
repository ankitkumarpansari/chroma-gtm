## Key Insights by Theme

### 🎯 GTM Strategy
- **2026-01-05 (Jeff)**: $20M run rate target by EOY. PLG caps at $1-2M; enterprise/OEM must cover ~$18M. Need week-by-week plan.
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: ICP is only 2-5k accounts; need high-touch, not SMB grind. SDR agency negotiation ongoing.
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: Best ICP = multi-tenant SaaS (Notion, Slack-like). Signal data: 5,800 companies hiring AI engineers.

### 💰 Fundraising
- **2026-01-05 (Jeff)**: Fundraising prep starts NOW. Demo options: Notion comparison vs multi-app context graphs. Need pitch deck, GTM plan, roadmap, financial model.
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: Raise in Jan 2025 window. Narrative: context layer + search agent, not "vector DB."

### 🛠️ Product Roadmap
- **2026-01-05 (Jeff)**: Q1 launches: MCMR (incl X.ai), Search Agent, Big Indexes V1. Later: Semantic Analytics, Agent Local State.
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: Search Agent → Observability → Context Layer → ChromaFS. Near-term focus on attach products.

### 📣 Marketing & Content
- **2026-01-06 (Jeff)**: Programmatic SEO for "Build X with Y using Chroma" (framework × use case). VIP activation with $500 credits + follow-up. Search accuracy = white space positioning.
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: 8-week content calendar with weekly announcements. Start with "won open source game."
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: Every update = text + video. LinkedIn organic via founder accounts > LinkedIn ads. Clarity + benchmarks in creative.

### 🎯 Positioning (Key Narrative)
- **2026-01-09 (Reify)**: "Sell the architecture, not just the product." Move from "vector DB" to "modern search infrastructure for AI" / "database for agents"
- **2026-01-09 (Reify)**: Create 3-5 named solution architectures (SQL search, token cost reduction, greenfield agents, brownfield augmentation)
- **2026-01-06 (Jeff)**: "Better search accuracy → lower token costs → better, faster, cheaper agents" = white space no one owns
- **2026-01-05 (Jeff)**: "Context layer + search agent + Databricks-like outcome" (not "vector DB")

### 📦 Packaging (from Reify)
- Website doesn't clearly communicate what's being sold
- Need to name and describe: Open Source, Fully Hosted Cloud, BYOC/On-Prem, Enterprise
- Clarifying "what can I buy" = critical to reduce funnel friction

### 🏢 Competitive Intel
- **2026-01-08 (Sumble)**: Turbopuffer = strong closed-source competitor ("Snowflake" to Chroma's "Databricks"). Elasticsearch/OpenSearch = primary displacement target where budget lives.
- **2024-12-22 (Jeff)**: Pinecone overspent early. TurboPuffer acquisition talks failed. PGVector companies = Search Agent targets.
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: TurboPuffer: 200-500k impressions per testimonial ad, Cursor co-brand worked. Vespa: benchmark-heavy ads. Pinecone dominates "split search" SEO.

### 💬 Sales Plays (from Sumble meeting)
| Play | Trigger | Message |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Elastic displacement** | GenAI + Elasticsearch/OpenSearch in job posts | "2x faster, 10x cheaper, zero operational burden" |
| **Net-new RAG/agent** | New RAG/agent project | "Chroma powers context for RAG and agents" |

### 📺 Paid Ads
- **2024-12-23 (Prash/Demand Curve)**: $5-10k/month budget. LinkedIn ABM (2k companies + job titles → 30-50k audience). Google/YouTube for retargeting competitor visitors. Reddit for devs.
- **2024-12-22 (TJ)**: Meta ~8% CTR (best), LinkedIn <1% CTR. Don't manage dashboards—hire specialists. Wait for clarity before heavy spend.

### 🤝 Agencies/Partners
- **2024-12-23 (Demand Curve)**: NDA sent to Justin. Prash = senior paid lead. Focus on SQLs not MQLs. Proposal pending.

### 🔧 GTM Infrastructure / Tooling
- **2026-01-08 (Sumble)**: Job-post signals, account scoring, urgent-account identification. Follow-up next week on scoring proposal.
- **2026-01-05 (Factors.ai)**: 15-day trial started. 75% account-level ID, LinkedIn attribution, ABM. Growth plan ~$20K/year if successful.
- **2024-12-23 (Common Room)**: Identity resolution + signal aggregation. 8-10% user-level ID (US only). Better GTM workflows, weaker ABM.
- **Also evaluating**: High Touch (reverse ETL), Rio.dev (GitHub signals)
- **Emerging stack**: PostHog (product) + HubSpot (CRM) + Factors (attribution) + Sumble (signals) + LinkedIn/Google (activation)
- **Key insight**: "Hard part isn't collecting signals—it's stitching them into one identity"

### Tool Comparison Summary
| Tool | Best For | Limitation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Reo.dev** | OSS signals, GitHub tracking, developer enrichment, ~20% ID rate | Less LinkedIn depth | 🟢 Trial started (beacon installed) |
| **Sumble** | Job-post signals, account scoring, urgency | Contact data weak | 🟡 Follow-up next week |
| **Factors.ai** | ABM, LinkedIn attribution, 75% account ID | Less developer-focused | 🟢 15-day trial |
| **Common Room** | GTM workflows, identity resolution | 8-10% ID (US only), weaker ABM | 🟡 Evaluating |

**Key Reo.dev claim**: ~200% better enrichment coverage than Common Room

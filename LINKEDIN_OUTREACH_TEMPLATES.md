## Response Templates

### When They Say "Tell me more"
```
Happy to!

In short: Chroma is the open-source embedding database that powers RAG applications.

What makes us different:
• Developer-first: pip install chromadb and you're running
• Production-ready: Used by 50,000+ developers
• Flexible: Self-host or use our cloud

For [Company], I think the most relevant thing would be [specific use case based on their company].

Would a quick call be helpful to dive deeper? I can show you some examples of how similar teams are using us.
```

---

### When They Say "Not interested right now"
```
Totally understand - timing is everything.

I'll keep sharing useful content here. If things change or you want to chat in the future, I'm always around.

Best of luck with [specific project/initiative they mentioned]!
```

---

### When They Say "We're using [Competitor]"
```
Nice! [Competitor] is solid.

Curious - how's it working for you? Any pain points?

We've had a few teams migrate from [Competitor] recently, mainly for [specific differentiator]. But if it's working well, no need to fix what isn't broken.

Either way, happy to stay connected and share learnings.
```

---

### When They Say "Send me more info"
```
Absolutely!

Here's a quick overview: [Link to one-pager or case study]

And here's a more detailed case study from a similar company: [Link]

Let me know if you have questions after reviewing. Happy to jump on a quick call to walk through anything.
```

---

### When They Ask About Pricing
```
Great question!

Quick overview:
• Open source: Free forever, self-hosted
• Cloud: Starts at $X/month, scales with usage

For [Company]'s scale (based on what I know), you'd likely be looking at [range].

But honestly, the best way to figure out the right fit is a quick call. I can give you a more accurate estimate based on your specific needs.

How's [Day] look?
```

---

### When They Want to Book a Call
```
Awesome, let's do it!

Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

Pick whatever works best for you. Looking forward to it!
```

---

## Objection Handling

### "We're too early for this"
```
Totally get it. Actually, that might be the best time to think about it.

The teams that struggle most are the ones who bolt on infrastructure later. Starting with the right foundation saves a ton of pain.

That said, Chroma is designed for exactly this - you can start local with pip install and scale when you're ready.

Want me to show you how other early-stage teams are setting things up?
```

---

### "We're building in-house"
```
Respect that! We've seen both approaches work.

Quick question: what's driving the build vs buy decision? 

In our experience, the teams that build in-house often underestimate the maintenance burden. But there are definitely cases where it makes sense.

Happy to share what we've learned either way - might save you some time.
```

---

### "We don't have budget"
```
Understood - budget constraints are real.

Good news: Chroma is open source. You can self-host for free.

We have teams running millions of vectors on their own infrastructure without paying us a dime.

If you want, I can share some resources on getting started with the self-hosted version?
```

---

### "I need to talk to my team"
```
Of course! Happy to help make that conversation easier.

A few things that might be useful:
• One-pager for technical team: [Link]
• Case study for leadership: [Link]
• Comparison with alternatives: [Link]

Want me to join a call with your team to answer questions directly?
```

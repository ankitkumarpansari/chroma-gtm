---

## Summary

Introductory strategy call between Chroma and Demand Curve's paid marketing lead to explore whether and how paid ads should fit into Chroma's GTM. Discussed Chroma's product, target market, funnel, constraints, and potential paid channels/tactics, and agreed to move toward a more detailed proposal under NDA.

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1) Demand Curve Agency Model & Capabilities

- **Background**: Prash has 15 years in paid (Meta, Shopify)
- **Model**: Boutique agency, 12-15 clients, senior point-of-contact, pod structure
- **Channels**: Meta, Google, LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Quora
- **Creative**: In-house (AI UGC, static, animated) but not full production/video shoots
- **Communication**: Slack, frequent calls

**Fit**: Senior-led, hands-on, suited for experimentation-heavy strategic paid program (not high-volume performance-only)

### 2) Chroma Product, ICP, and Funnel

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Product** | Vector DB / Search Agent for AI retrieval (Elastic/OpenSearch-like) |
| **Example** | "Every time you put a file inside Grok and search something, it's going through Chroma" |
| **ICP** | ~2,000 qualified global companies: Series A-C+ AI/tech startups with RAG/semantic search workloads |
| **Buyers** | Engineering leadership, applied AI teams |
| **Funnel** | Open-source → Chroma Cloud signup → Consultative sales |
| **Sales cycle** | 1 week (~$10k) to 3-6 months (~$2M) |

**Key insight**: Niche, high-ACV, technical B2B motion. Focus on SQLs and quality, not volume.

### 3) Current GTM/Marketing Gaps

**Existing motion**:
- Outbound: technographic discovery, comparators, AI-based expansion → email + LinkedIn
- Inbound: SEO, open-source awareness (25k stars, 100M downloads, 5M/month installs), YouTube
- Paid: Light experiments only ($6-7k/month), no expert management

**Gap**: Paid is greenfield. Need careful introduction with clear tracking/attribution and SQL focus.

### 4) Proposed Paid Strategy & Channels

| Channel | Strategy | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **LinkedIn** | ABM-style: upload 2,000 target companies, overlay job titles | Thought-leadership ads from human persona, not just brand. Target 30-50k addressable users for reasonable CPCs |
| **Google/YouTube** | Capture intent on non-branded terms | Retargeting + custom segments for competitor-site visitors |
| **Reddit** | Test in r/machinelearning, r/rag, r/database | Where developers hang out |

**Budget**: $5-10k/month (modest, focused)

**Conclusion**: Chroma is NOT too early for ads. ABM + thought-leadership emphasis is appropriate.

### 5) Programmatic Personalization & Tracking

**Ankit's idea**: Use Chroma's Signal DB to programmatically generate segmented campaigns (e.g., "Harvey-like" clusters of 30-40 companies)

**Constraints discussed**:
- LinkedIn minimum audience sizes
- Cost inflation if segments too small
- "Creepiness" of hyper-personalized messaging

**Prerequisite**: Robust UTM and attribution setup before any serious experiment

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Proceed toward engagement** | Send NDA to Justin (Demand Curve CEO) for deeper data sharing |
| **Success metric** | SQLs (sales-qualified leads), not MQLs or generic traffic |
| **Initial budget** | $5-10k/month given niche audience and ABM nature |

*Note: No hard decision to formally start a campaign yet; this is exploratory.*

---

## Action Items

### Immediate
- [ ] **Ankit**: Send NDA to Justin (Demand Curve CEO) - *Today/ASAP*
- [ ] **Prash**: Inform Justin about incoming NDA (3 PM call same day)

### Post-NDA
- [ ] **Ankit**: Prepare GTM/paid-ads context package (funnel data, target account list, competitor examples, GTM stack)
- [ ] **Joint (Ankit + Prash)**: Define tracking & UTM framework before any campaign launch

---

## GTM Insights

### Customer Signals
- **Buyer profile**: Series A-C+ AI/tech startups with RAG/semantic search workloads
- **Personas**: Engineering leaders, applied AI engineers, AI founders
- **Behavior**: Once they choose a DB, rarely change for 1-2 years → timing is critical
- **In-market signals**: RAG workloads, vector DB usage, job boards, tech stack, competitor usage
- **Constraint**: Only ~2,000 strong-fit buyers globally → ABM, not broad performance

### Competitive Intelligence
- Market is "extremely competitive" with many vector DBs
- Competitors actively running ads on these audiences
- **Opportunity**: Google/YouTube custom segments of competitor website visitors for retargeting

### Positioning / Messaging
- **Core position**: "Search agent" / vector DB for AI-native workloads (like Elastic/OpenSearch for AI)
- **Concrete example**: "Every time you put a file inside Grok and search something, it's going through Chroma"
- **Emphasis**: Chroma powers AI features reliably at scale, not just "vector DB" buzzwords
- **Social proof**: 25k stars, 100M downloads, high-credibility customers (X.ai/Grok)
- **LinkedIn tone**: Long-form, thoughtful posts explaining architecture tradeoffs > short generic creatives

### Market Insights
- Vector DB is now core infra, not niche add-on
- Open-source/pip installs drive huge top-of-funnel in devtools
- **Opportunity**: Leverage open-source adoption to upsell to Chroma Cloud
- **Threat**: High switching costs + infrequent DB changes = missing evaluation windows is costly
- **Risk**: Overly narrow targeting → unsustainable CPCs/CPMs

### LinkedIn / Outreach Ideas

**Paid**:
- Thought-leadership ads from Ankit/technical leaders (long-text posts)
- Topics: RAG architectures, "search agent" mental model, vector DB gotchas at scale
- ABM: Upload 2,000 companies + job title overlay → 30-50k addressable professionals
- Use engagement signals (comments, likes) to trigger outreach

**Organic**:
- Deep technical posts (Demand Curve style for devtools)
- Promote YouTube content as native LinkedIn posts

**Automation**:
- Integrate Signal DB into outbound email/LinkedIn sequencing
- Segment-based LinkedIn Ads audiences
- Cluster-based campaigns (respect minimum audience thresholds)

## Follow-up Required

- **Next steps**: NDA execution → proposal review → potential "part two" call
- **Loop in**: Justin (Demand Curve CEO) for NDA and contract

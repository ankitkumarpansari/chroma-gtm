<!-- SI Partner Email 1: Welcome & Quick Win -->
<!-- Subject: Your Chroma Partner Account is Ready – Here's Your First Win -->

<p>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</p>

<p>Thanks for joining the Chroma Partner Program! I noticed {{company.name}} has a strong AI/ML practice, and I wanted to personally reach out.</p>

<p><strong>Quick context:</strong> Chroma is the #1 open-source vector database, and our Cloud product is now production-ready. We're seeing massive demand from enterprises building RAG applications, AI agents, and semantic search.</p>

<p><strong>Why this matters for {{company.name}}:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your clients are asking about vector databases (they all are)</li>
  <li>Chroma is the easiest to implement (2-line setup)</li>
  <li>We have case studies from enterprise clients you can reference</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your quick win:</strong><br>
I'd love to set up a 30-min partner enablement call where I can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Walk you through our partner portal & resources</li>
  <li>Share our top use cases by industry</li>
  <li>Discuss any client opportunities you're seeing</li>
</ol>

<p>Are you free this week for a quick call?</p>

<p>Best,<br>
Ankit</p>

<p><em>P.S. – We just launched SOC 2 Type II compliance, which I know is critical for enterprise deals.</em></p>

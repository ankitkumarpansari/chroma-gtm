<!-- SI Partner Email 7: Final Follow-Up / Break-Up -->
<!-- Subject: Should I close your file? -->

<p>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</p>

<p>I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back – totally understand if the timing isn't right.</p>

<p>Before I close out, I wanted to ask:</p>

<p><strong>Is it one of these?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>⏰ <strong>Timing:</strong> Not a priority right now (totally fine, I'll check back in Q2)</li>
  <li>🤔 <strong>Questions:</strong> Need more info before engaging (happy to answer anything)</li>
  <li>👥 <strong>Wrong person:</strong> Should I be talking to someone else at {{company.name}}?</li>
  <li>❌ <strong>Not interested:</strong> No worries, I'll remove you from outreach</li>
</ol>

<p>Just hit reply with the number, and I'll adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Either way, the partner portal is always available if your team wants to explore Chroma for client projects.</p>

<p>Best,<br>
Ankit</p>

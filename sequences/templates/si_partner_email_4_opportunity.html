<!-- SI Partner Email 4: Customer Opportunity -->
<!-- Subject: Quick question about your Q1 pipeline -->

<p>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</p>

<p>I'll keep this short –</p>

<p>Do you have any clients currently:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Building RAG / AI assistant applications?</li>
  <li>Evaluating vector databases?</li>
  <li>Struggling with Pinecone costs or Elasticsearch complexity?</li>
</ol>

<p>If yes, I'd love to explore a co-sell. Here's what we bring:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical support:</strong> Our engineers on the call</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive positioning:</strong> We win 70%+ against Pinecone on cost</li>
  <li><strong>Fast POC:</strong> Get a working demo in &lt;1 week</li>
</ul>

<p>We've done this successfully with other SI partners for their enterprise clients.</p>

<p>Any opportunities come to mind?</p>

<p>Best,<br>
Ankit</p>

<p><em>P.S. – We also have a referral bonus for partner-sourced deals. Happy to share details.</em></p>

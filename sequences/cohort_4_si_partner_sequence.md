## 📧 Email Sequence

### **Email 1: Partner Welcome & Quick Win** (Day 0)
**Subject Line Options:**
- `Your Chroma Partner Account is Ready – Here's Your First Win`
- `[Partner Name] x Chroma: Let's Land Your First AI Customer Together`
- `Quick question about your AI practice, [First Name]`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for joining the Chroma Partner Program! I noticed [Company] has a strong AI/ML practice, and I wanted to personally reach out.

Quick context: Chroma is the #1 open-source vector database, and our Cloud product is now production-ready. We're seeing massive demand from enterprises building RAG applications, AI agents, and semantic search.

**Why this matters for [Company]:**
- Your clients are asking about vector databases (they all are)
- Chroma is the easiest to implement (2-line setup)
- We have case studies from [relevant industry] you can reference

**Your quick win:**
I'd love to set up a 30-min partner enablement call where I can:
1. Walk you through our partner portal & resources
2. Share our top use cases by industry
3. Discuss any client opportunities you're seeing

Are you free [Day] or [Day] this week?

Best,
Ankit

P.S. – We just launched SOC 2 Type II compliance, which I know is critical for enterprise deals.

### **Email 2: Industry-Specific Value** (Day 3)
**Subject Line Options:**
- `How [Similar SI] closed a $200K AI deal with Chroma`
- `The AI use case your [Industry] clients are asking about`
- `[First Name], quick AI opportunity question`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note – wanted to share something relevant.

**The pattern we're seeing:**
Every major enterprise is building some form of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application. Whether it's:
- **Internal knowledge search** (HR, legal, support docs)
- **Customer-facing AI assistants** (support bots, product search)
- **Document analysis** (contracts, compliance, research)

The challenge? Most vector databases are either:
- Too complex to deploy (Milvus, Weaviate)
- Too expensive at scale (Pinecone)
- Not production-ready (pgvector)

**Where [Company] wins:**
You bring the implementation expertise + client relationships. We bring the infrastructure that actually works.

Here's a one-pager on our top 5 enterprise use cases: [LINK]

Worth a quick call to discuss how this maps to your current pipeline?

Best,
Ankit

### **Email 4: Customer Opportunity** (Day 10)
**Subject Line Options:**
- `[First Name], do you have any clients building AI search?`
- `Quick question about your Q1 pipeline`
- `Potential co-sell opportunity?`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short – 

Do you have any clients currently:
1. Building RAG / AI assistant applications?
2. Evaluating vector databases?
3. Struggling with Pinecone costs or Elasticsearch complexity?

If yes, I'd love to explore a co-sell. Here's what we bring:
- **Technical support**: Our engineers on the call
- **Competitive positioning**: We win 70%+ against Pinecone on cost
- **Fast POC**: Get a working demo in <1 week

We've done this successfully with [similar SI] for their [industry] clients.

Any opportunities come to mind?

Best,
Ankit

P.S. – We also have a referral bonus for partner-sourced deals. Happy to share details.

### **Email 5: Case Study & Social Proof** (Day 14)
**Subject Line Options:**
- `How [Enterprise Client] built AI search in 2 weeks with Chroma`
- `Case study: [Industry] AI implementation`
- `[First Name], thought you'd find this relevant`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a recent win that might be relevant for [Company]'s clients:

**Case Study: [Enterprise Client Name]**
- **Challenge**: Needed semantic search across 10M+ documents
- **Previous Solution**: Elasticsearch (too slow, too expensive)
- **Chroma Result**: 
  - 2x faster query performance
  - 60% cost reduction
  - Deployed in 3 weeks

Full case study: [LINK]

**Why this matters for your clients:**
Most enterprises have the same pattern – they're either:
1. Using Elasticsearch and hitting performance walls
2. Evaluating Pinecone and getting sticker shock
3. Trying to build something in-house (bad idea)

Chroma is the "just works" option that your technical teams will love.

Would any of your current clients benefit from seeing this?

Best,
Ankit

**Subject Line Options:**
- `Should I close your file?`
- `[First Name], one last thing`
- `Timing not right?`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back – totally understand if the timing isn't right.

Before I close out, I wanted to ask:

**Is it one of these?**
1. ⏰ **Timing**: Not a priority right now (totally fine, I'll check back in Q2)
2. 🤔 **Questions**: Need more info before engaging (happy to answer anything)
3. 👥 **Wrong person**: Should I be talking to someone else at [Company]?
4. ❌ **Not interested**: No worries, I'll remove you from outreach

Just hit reply with the number, and I'll adjust accordingly.

Either way, the partner portal is always available at [LINK] if your team wants to explore Chroma for client projects.

Best,
Ankit

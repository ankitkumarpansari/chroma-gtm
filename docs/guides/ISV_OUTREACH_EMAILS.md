- B: "What made you choose Chroma?"
- C: "{Company} + Chroma - quick question"

**Body:**

```
Hi {FirstName},

I'm Ankit from the Chroma team. I noticed {Company} is using Chroma, and I wanted to reach out personally.

We're trying to understand what's actually working for teams like yours. Would you mind answering one quick question?

**What was the main reason you chose Chroma for {Company}?**

- [ ] Open source / self-hostable
- [ ] Developer experience / ease of use
- [ ] Performance / speed
- [ ] Cost (it's free)
- [ ] Specific feature: ___________
- [ ] Other: ___________

Just reply with a letter or a quick note. Takes 10 seconds.

If you have time for a 15-min call to share more, I'd love to hear your story. We're always looking to feature customers doing interesting things.

Thanks,
Ankit

P.S. - If Chroma isn't working well for you, I want to know that too. Honest feedback helps us improve.

**Body:**

```
Hi {FirstName},

Following up on my note from a few days ago.

I'm genuinely curious what's working (or not working) for {Company} with Chroma.

Even a one-line reply would be super helpful:
- "We use it because ___________"
- "The best part is ___________"
- "We wish it had ___________"

Thanks for your time,
Ankit

### Email 3: Final Follow-up (Day 7, if no response)

**Subject**: "Last note from me"

**Body:**

```
Hi {FirstName},

Last follow-up from me, I promise.

If you have 30 seconds, I'd love to know one thing:

**Is Chroma solving a real problem for {Company}, or is it just "good enough for now"?**

Either answer is helpful. We're building the roadmap for 2026 and want to make sure we're solving the right problems.

Thanks for considering,
Ankit

P.S. - If you ever want to chat about RAG architecture, embedding strategies, or just swap notes, I'm always up for it. No agenda.

### Typical Journeys

1. **Cohort 2 → Cohort 1**: In-market company evaluates Chroma, becomes customer
2. **Cohort 2 → Cohort 3**: In-market company chooses competitor (we nurture for future)
3. **Cohort 3 → Cohort 1**: Competitor customer switches to Chroma
4. **Cohort 1 → Cohort 4**: Customer becomes so successful they start implementing for others

## 📋 Quick Reference: Identifying Cohort

### Decision Tree

```
Is the company already using Chroma?
├── YES → COHORT 1 (Current Customer)
│
└── NO → Are they using a competitor vector DB?
         ├── YES → COHORT 3 (Competitor Customer)
         │
         └── NO → Are they a consultancy/agency implementing AI for clients?
                  ├── YES → COHORT 4 (SI Partner)
                  │
                  └── NO → Are they showing in-market signals (hiring AI, building AI)?
                           ├── YES → COHORT 2 (In-Market)
                           │
                           └── NO → Not yet in our target segments

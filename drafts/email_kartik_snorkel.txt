Subject: Chroma + Snorkel AI

Hey Kartik,

I'm Ankit - I lead growth at Chroma. Saw you're leading AI Infrastructure at Snorkel and thought there might be some interesting overlap.

You're building the data layer that teaches AI systems - we're building the context layer that helps them remember and retrieve. Feels like a natural pairing.

A few ways Chroma could plug into what you're doing:

- **Dataset curation**: Semantic deduplication, finding similar examples across large corpora, clustering training data by topic
- **Evaluation pipelines**: Retrieving relevant test cases for benchmarks, semantic similarity scoring for model outputs
- **Client solutions**: When you're building RAG apps for customers, Chroma handles the retrieval piece

We work with a lot of AI infra teams - happy to share what we're seeing work well.

Would love to chat if you're curious. Also happy to set up a shared Slack channel if that's easier.

Have cc'd Jeff, our founder, to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: Really cool that you're partnering with Anthropic on their data needs. We're big fans of what they're doing.

NOTES FOR ANKIT:
- Lead type: AI Infrastructure company (Startup, Series B+)
- Why Chroma fits: Snorkel builds datasets/benchmarks for AI - semantic search is useful for data curation, deduplication, and evaluation
- Gesture: Offer $1,000 credits if they engage
- Key insight: Snorkel's whole business is about data quality for AI training. Chroma can help them organize, dedupe, and retrieve from large datasets programmatically
- Their partners: Anthropic (mentioned on their site) - adds credibility
- Kartik's role: Director of Engineering for AI Infrastructure & Data Platform - perfect person to evaluate infra tools

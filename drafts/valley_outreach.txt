Subject: Earlier call + our GTM stack

Hey Zayd,

Saw no slots in January - any chance we can do something sooner? Happy to work around your schedule.

Quick context: I lead growth at Chroma (the open-source vector database - 100M+ downloads, 25k GitHub stars). We're building out our LinkedIn outreach motion and curious how Valley could help scale it.

Our current GTM stack:
- CRM: Attio
- LinkedIn automation: Dux-Soup + custom Playwright scripts
- Lead discovery: Chroma-powered semantic search + job post signals
- Enrichment: Mix of Clay, Apollo, internal scripts
- Email: Gmail API automation

Looking to level up the LinkedIn piece specifically.

Talk soon!

Hey Guillaume,

I see you're trying out Chroma Cloud - welcome!

Checked out HRC Software - excited to see what you're building!

There are a bunch of ways Chroma can help, especially around semantic search, RAG, and intelligent content retrieval for AI applications.

Happy to set you up with:
- Extended credits to test at scale
- Direct Slack channel for technical support
- Call to discuss your use case

If you're building a retrieval app, check out our Search API: https://docs.trychroma.com/cloud/search-api/overview

I'm happy to hop on a call or set up a shared Slack channel, whatever works best for you.

Have cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: Bumped your credits to $1,000 to get you started!

Hey Shishir,

I'm Ankit. I lead growth at Chroma. Have also cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma.

Saw you're trying out Chroma Cloud - welcome! Looks like you're building AI solutions for clients at Empowered Margins.

We work with a lot of consulting partners who use Chroma for client projects. Happy to set you up with:
- Extended credits for client POCs
- Direct Slack channel for technical support
- Early access to new features

Let me know if helpful!

PS: What company are you building for? I can also provide relevant case studies for you to present.

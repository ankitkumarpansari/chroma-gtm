Hey Edward,

I see you're trying out Chroma Cloud - welcome!

Checked out PromptingCo - really cool what you're building! Helping brands get cited by LLMs and routing AI traffic from ChatGPT, Perplexity, and others is exactly the kind of use case where Chroma shines, especially around semantic search and intelligent content retrieval.

There are a bunch of ways Chroma can boost what you're doing, especially around:
- Fast, accurate vector search for routing AI traffic
- Semantic search over your content library
- Hybrid search with RRF for better LLM citations

Happy to hop on a call or set up a shared Slack channel.

Have cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: Bumped your credits to $1,000 as a small gesture!

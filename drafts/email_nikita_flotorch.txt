Subject: Chroma Cloud + FloTorch

Hey Nikita,

I see you're trying out Chroma Cloud - welcome!

Checked out FloTorch - really cool what you're building! An enterprise-grade AI gateway for agentic workflows, RAG pipelines, and LLM routing is exactly the kind of use case where Chroma shines, especially around datastore switching and RAG pipeline management.

There are a bunch of ways Chroma can boost what you're doing, especially around:
- Fast, reliable vector search for your RAG pipelines
- Easy datastore switching with our API
- Enterprise-grade performance and security for your platform
- Observability and monitoring integration

Happy to hop on a call or set up a shared Slack channel to discuss how Chroma can fit into your platform architecture.

Have cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: Bumped your credits to $1,000 as a small gesture!

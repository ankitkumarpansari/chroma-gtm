Hey Isaac,

I see you're trying out Chroma Cloud - welcome!

I've been checking out Zoox - really cool what you're building with AI Labs and your Data Core platform. There are a bunch of ways we can boost what Zoox offers, especially around semantic search and retrieval for your AI agents and intelligent dashboards.

If you're building retrieval apps, check out our Search API: https://docs.trychroma.com/cloud/search-api/overview

It supports generic vector search and hybrid with RRF.

I'm happy to hop on a call or set up a shared Slack channel, whatever works best for you.

Have cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: I am bumping up your credit to $500 as a small gesture!

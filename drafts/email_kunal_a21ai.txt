Hey Kunal,

I see you're trying out Chroma Cloud - welcome!

I've been checking out a21.ai - really cool what you're building with RAG(E) and LLM customization for enterprise clients. There are a bunch of ways we can boost what a21.ai offers, especially around semantic search and retrieval for your client implementations.

We work with a lot of consulting partners who use Chroma for client projects. Happy to set you up with:
- Extended credits for client POCs
- Direct Slack channel for technical support
- Early access to new features

If you're building retrieval apps, check out our Search API: https://docs.trychroma.com/cloud/search-api/overview

I'm happy to hop on a call or set up a shared Slack channel, whatever works best for you.

Have cc'd Jeff, founder of Chroma to the thread. Talk soon!

PS: What client projects are you working on? I can share relevant case studies.

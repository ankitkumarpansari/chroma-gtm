# Chroma GTM Approach & Guardrails

## One-Pager | January 2026

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> **"Use GTM engineering and AI to avoid needing a 40-person sales org."**

We build automated systems that do the work of a large sales team. Every manual process should become a repeatable, scalable workflow.

## 📊 Revenue Model

| Source | 2026 Target | Strategy |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **PLG** | $1-2M max | Supporting channel, not primary |
| **Enterprise/OEM** | ~$18M | Must come from larger accounts |
| **Total** | $20M ARR | Requires ~2x monthly growth |

**Key Insight**: PLG has a ceiling. Enterprise/OEM is where the revenue comes from.

❌ Manual data entry or CRM updates  
❌ Attend conferences without a plan
